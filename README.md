# Game_website

In this website I am working on scss. To get start, I need follow these steps:

    1- Create the package.json 
    2- Install node modules by using npm i -D node-sass so that I get the dev independancy
    3- Create gitignore file to ignore the node_modules
    4- Once the package is created, edit the scripts code about css and css watch to run the code

## Get started to code

I create a new repostory called game-website and I clone it inside the scss path, also I created my own branch instead of using branch master.

## The design

I have a figma app and I work with that to help me

## Requirement

I have to indent my work and comment it to make it understandable. 
In addition, everytime I have changes I have to commit it and push if I want to.

**Message**

I hope I will have a lot of improvement by doing this website.

***I pray I am going to enjoy my work***
